 # Personal Portfolio Coding Project README

## Description

In this project, I am building a comprehensive portfolio page that reflects my skills, experiences, and accomplishments. By incorporating a range of interactive elements and a responsive design, I aim to provide a user-friendly experience for potential employers and collaborators.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Displayed the developer's name and a recent photo or avatar prominently upon loading the portfolio.
2. Enabled smooth scrolling to corresponding sections upon clicking navigation links.
3. Presented a section with titled images of the developer's applications upon clicking the link to the work section.
4. Ensured the first application's image is larger than the others in the work section.
5. Redirected users to the respective deployed applications upon clicking the images of the applications.
6. Implemented a responsive layout that smoothly adapts to various screen sizes and devices without compromising the user experience.
